## Purpose

Projman is a demand tracking and delivery governance tool that helps small IT teams visualize and manage work from ideation through deployment. It is aimed at teams that must balance incoming requests against limited resources while assigning the right people based on skills and availability. The application solves the problem of lost or misrouted work requests, unclear ownership, and overloaded staff by providing lifecycle tracking, skills-based staffing, workload visualization, and audit trails.

## Tech Stack

Laravel 12, PHP 8.4, livewire, flux, flux-pro
